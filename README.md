# RaceConditionProject
Race Condition Project for final of CS 4310, CPP Fall 2021

The RaceCondition class has the methods and classes needed to show the race condition in action and the semaphores in action.
The ShowRaceCondition class has the methods and classes needed to show the race condition.
The UsingSemaphores class has the methods and classes needed to show the use of semaphores.

When using the RaceCondition class, choose the method and then run the main method.
For both the ShowRaceCondition and the UsingSemaphores classes, run the main method in order to see the intended program outputs (will need to terminate in order to end).

All classes are currently programmed to output the contents of the buffer. There are other comments that allow other parts of the program to be outputted.
